			<em>ArtStream</em> is an invitational and crowdsourced art exhibit&mdash;a show of dynamic collective concioussness and art activity. We are  the virtual home of The Watercolor Club, originated by Lori Ortiz in the summer of 2013, and carried on by Jeffrey Cyphers Wright and members. Please see and join here or on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/631672933518619/">Facebook page</a>. The Club held RLEvents in the Lower East Side community garden Dias y Flores until real estate interests prevailed. Use <em>Artstream</em> to show and share work in watercolor. <em>Artstream</em> welcomes The Club and all manner of on-topic artwork. The topic is discovery of and through watercolor.
